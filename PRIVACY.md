# Privacy Policy

The purpose of this document is to provide clear details of how this app handles the privacy of the users.

This app collects metric data about user performance! This is actually a primary function of the app, as it is a demo app for scheduling notifications based on time series data such as metric data. The metric reflects the user's overall completion for the learning outcomes of the app. Additionally, detailed information about current and previous progress through the app is collected as needed in delivery of the contents of the app.

The _Behavior-based notifications_ app and its backend are the only others programs that will make use of any of the data. Any third party with whom an app shares user data (in compliance with these Guidelines) — such as analytics tools, advertising networks and third-party SDKs, as well as any parent, subsidiary or other related entities that will have access to user data — will provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the app’s privacy policy and required by these Guidelines.

Data retention/deletion - Sensitive data is not unduly maintained by the app and stored on its services. Users may revoke consent and/or request deletion of the user’s data by email, using the same email address to which the app is registered.
